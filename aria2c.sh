# Downloads robots.txt files from the daily top 1 million sites in Alexa's toplist
# Written by Spirit, 20110617ff, do what you want with it

# Downloads to ./files/a/archiveteam.org/YYYYMMDD
# Stores input and log files in ./meta/
# Temporary files will be inside your current directory

# TODO: Remove first empty line in the domain list
# ARGH: Why does aria2c download some files as gzipped data? Wget does not do this. Examples are chinaren.com, sohu.com

# ARGH: The domains come without subdomains, so it might be a good idea to download the www.$domain/robots.txt instead or in addition. Without www. I got ~7500/10000, with www. I got 7800/10000
# YAY:  If downloading 100k use this for checking how many files you got down: find files/*/*/20110628 -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l | wc -l
# takes 300min to download 100k
# takes 60min to 7z 100k
